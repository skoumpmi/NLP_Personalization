python file : Plot_Distribution_between_known_unknown_words.py

Scope: Plot the textual data in relation with the distribution of known (on-vocabulary) and unknown (out-of-vocabulary) words.

Execution:
Before running specify the paths you have the realtive data in the config.ini file

Output:
1. Plot the frequency of total number of known and unknown words per dataset.

2. Plot the frequency  of total number of unique known and unique unknown words per dataset.

3. Plot the percentage of total number of known words and total number of unknown words in relation with total number of words per dataset.

4. Plot the percentage of total number of unique known words and total number of unique unknown words in relation with total number of unique words per dataset.

5. Plot the distribution of percentage of known words in every sentence in relation with the percentage of sentences of all train datasets. 

6. Plot the distribution of percentage of known words in every sentence in relation with the percentage of sentences of all test datasets. 

7. The *.csv files with all that statistics for each dataset.

8. The 'All_datasets_results.txt' with the statistics of textual data distribution for all datasets

python file : Word _Frequency_Distribution.py

Scope: Plot the frequency of first 500 most common words for each dataset.


Execution:
Before running specify the paths you have the realtive data in the config.ini file

Output:

For the purpose of having more interpretable plots for each dataset it is created 5 plots,
1. The first plot contains the 1st to 100th most common words. 

2. The second plot contains the 101th to 200th most common words. 

3. The third plot contains the 201th to 300th most common words. 

4. The fourth plot contains the 301th to 400th most common words. 

5. The fifth plot contains the 401th to 500th most common words.
